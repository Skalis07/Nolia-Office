# 🌿 Nolia Office

*(Spanish version available [here](README.es.md))*

**Nolia Office** is a website created by **Skalis07** as a virtual space to relax, study, or work peacefully.
It is inspired by [NookOffice](https://github.com/VijiatJack/nookoffice) and uses *Animal Crossing*-themed visuals to create a warm and cozy atmosphere.
The code has been developed from scratch, incorporating aesthetic changes and functional improvements.

## 💡 Inspiration and Origin

This project was born with two main goals:  

1. To provide a digital place for my girlfriend to study and relax, allowing me to add or edit anything she needs, made by me.  
2. To carry out a practical web development exercise, since until now I had never worked on a complete project, allowing me to learn, practice, and showcase my skills.

## ✨ Features

## 🛠️ How It Works

**Nolia Office** is a static web application built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).  
On the client side, JavaScript handles:

- Determining the current GIF and allowing it to be changed.
- Playing background music via the YouTube API.
- Controlling volume, pausing/resuming, and toggling ambient sounds.
- Switching between day and night modes.
- Adjusting the GIF frame to maintain the original aspect ratio or crop correctly.
- Adjusting styles so it works embedded in Notion without losing functionality.

## 🔮 Future Plans (probably not XD)

- More music.
- **Custom playlists** system.
- **Pomodoro timer** for study/work sessions.
- **More sound effects** (waves, wind, coffee shop).
- Add more GIFs and backgrounds for automatic rotation.
